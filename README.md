# ethereum_blockchain_dapp_flutter (https://github.com/GitLeandroHub/Ethereum_Flutter_Dapp_SmartContract_Blockchain_web3_Metamask)

A Dapp (Decentralized application) that uses smart contract (Ropsten Testnet) and Metamask for the Privatekey and wallet from Ethereum blockchain and connects all together by using Flutter framework and Dart language (Web3dart)

For this project some tools and skills were needed:
- Dart language (Web3dart)
- Solidity (for Smart Contract)
- Remix to compile and deploy the Smart Contract (Abi, contract address)
- Metamask for the Ropsten testnet wallet (wallet address and Private key)
- Vscode for the flutter and dart code and Emulation - windows desktop (Dapp)
- Infura for watch and manage the ropsten network
- .env to Avoid Uploading the Private Key to GitHub and to hide from the code itself
- velocity_x for fast and beautiful ux designs of the app
